 - task name and stats
 - fix block window on pomodoro end

bugs:
 - Pomodoro toolkit window is disabled when project is being indexed (for example, maven and IDE talk windows are not disabled)
 - after restart pomodoro rings without a good reason

Would be nice to have:
 - integration with tasks
 - statistics, task name (with auto-completion)
